        <h3><b>About Naruto Legend</b></h3>
        <li>
            <h5>Naruto A Fictional Charachter</h5>
            <p>Naruto Uzumakiis the titular protagonist of the
                manga Naruto, created by Masashi Kishimoto.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>His Personality</h5>
            <p> As the series progresses, he is a young ninja from the fictional village (Hidden Leaf
                Village). The villagers ridicule and ostracize Naruto on account of the Nine-Tailed fox malevolent
                creature that attacked village and was sealed away in Naruto's body. Despite this, he aspires to
                become his village's leader, the Hokage, in order to receive their approval. His carefree, optimistic,
                and
                boisterous personality enables him to befriend other village ninja, as well as ninja from other
                villages. </p>

        <li>
            <h5>Back Story</h5>
            <p>Naruto is an orphan who has a dangerous fox-like entity known as Kurama the Nine-Tailed Fox sealed within
                his body by his father, the Fourth Hokage Minato Namikaze, the leader of Konoha's ninja force, at the
                cost of his own life and that of his wife, Kushina Uzumaki</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <h5>Naruto Never Gives Up!</h5>
                Sasuke (immature, confused, & angsty as he is) was one of the first members of Naruto's self-made
                family.
                Naruto is determined to fight to protect his family, but that's not all. He wants to protect his family
                from
                themselves as well as any enemy who would kill them. Naruto (even at the Chuunin Exam arc) is mature
                enough
                to know that he could have destroyed himself if he let anger and violence rule his actions. That is why
                Naruto keeps "wasting time" trying to change Sasuke's mind. He wants Sasuke to reconsider revenge and
                seek
                justice instead. In the manga, Naruto makes a very notable distinction between justice and revenge when
                he
                talks to Sasuke and declares that they would both die if they duke it out.

                <h5> Naruto is a Relatable, Flawed Human Being</h5>
                We love him for his flaws, not just despite them. For instance, Naruto is kind to a fault. He is
                persevering to a fault. He is loyal to a fault. But we love that about him.

                In the Shippuden arc, he deals with a ton of internal struggles. After Pein's defeat, Naruto became the
                famous hero of the Leaf. Fame means influence. And influence often surpasses physical power. Naruto's
                essential qualities (loyalty & perseverance) & newfound fame make him respected among ninjas
                worldwide.
